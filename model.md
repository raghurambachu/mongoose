Modelling data

- decide app is read heavy or write heavy
- decide whether a collection is required or not
- Embedding vs references
- proper indexing(it affects write operation)
- arrays as first class citizens

#### Embedding and Referencing

Embedded documents are where sub-document are present in same collection as parent
instead of creatng a new collection for subdocuments. This feature is called
denormalization.

In referencing, we create new collection for sub-document and reference
it to parent document. These are also known as normalized collection.

#### Project(Completed Project : https://github.com/raghurambachu/pranalika)

Design a model for a blog system where a user can log in and create blogs and create comment on each of those blogs.

Associate them in a way that each of the schemas should have references to other schema related to them in some ways.

- It may require 3 different models for storing Users, Articles and Comments.
- each user should contains reference to articles he/she has created
- each article should have reference to its author/creator from user Schema
- each comment should have reference to the article for which comment has been made and also a reference to its creator.
- each article should also have refernces to all the comments made on them.

create a project folder in the root and design the schemas and models required for the project.

- also create a project.md and explain how you approached the model creation ?
- also mention other possible ways to design the blog model ?
